## Installation
The file in this repository is an .apk file, otherwise known as an Android Package. As a result, you will either need an Android device with Android 5.0 or later or an Android emulator.
### Installation on an Android device:
Simply download the .apk file onto your device. Then, once the download is complete, find the file in your downloads folder, tap the file, and tap "Yes" when prompted. The app will begin installing on your device. 
### Installation on an Emulator:
There are many emulators that are free to use on the internet. However, I recommend using BlueStacks' App Player (https://www.bluestacks.com/download.html), as it is simple to use and will provide excellent performance. Download the app player and open it. Then, it is as simple as dragging and dropping the .apk file into the App Player, and waiting for it to install.
