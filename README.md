# Tempus
Tempus is a time management application that helps you stay on top of your schedule. With Tempus, you can easily create events and receive notifications to stay on track throughout the day. 

## Features
- Create events with a title, date, time, and location.
- View your schedule for the day, week, month, or year.
- Receive notifications to get ready, leave, and arrive on time for events.
- Edit or delete events as necessary.
- Sync events across multiple devices by logging into your account.

## Installation
The file in this repository is an .apk file, otherwise known as an Android Package. As a result, you will either need an Android device with Android 5.0 or later or an Android emulator.
### Installation on an Android device:
Simply download the .apk file onto your device. Then, once the download is complete, find the file in your downloads folder, tap the file, and tap "Yes" when prompted. The app will begin installing on your device. 
### Installation on an Emulator:
There are many emulators that are free to use on the internet. However, I recommend using the BlueStacks App Player (https://www.bluestacks.com/download.html), as it is simple to use and will provide excellent performance. Download the app player and open it. Then, it is as simple as dragging and dropping the .apk file into the App Player, and waiting for it to install. 

## Getting Started
To use Tempus, you will need to create an account for free and log in. Once you're logged in, you can view your schedule a month at a time and begin creating events. To create an event, simply tap on the top right button with a "+" symbol and fill in the details of the event. Then, click the "Create Event" button at the bottom and you will be able to view your events by clicking the relevant date on the calendar. Users will then be notified of this event as they get closer to the relevant date and time. 
To delete or edit events, simply tap the event in question below the calendar and tap the relevant button. 
To log out of your account, simply tap the top left button in the calendar screen.
